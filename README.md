## Installation

Follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Arctic Fox or newer recommended)
- Android SDK [Minimum API Level] or higher
- JDK [Version] (Usually comes bundled with Android Studio)
### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourProjectName].git
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio:**
    Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project" and choose the cloned directory.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Android Studio usually starts Gradle sync automatically when you open the project and downloads the necessary dependencies. If it doesn't, click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button.
4.  **(Optional) API Keys:**
    If your project uses external services (Firebase, Google Maps, etc.), you might need to add your own API keys to the `local.properties` file or your project's appropriate configuration file. For example:
    ```properties
    # local.properties (This file should be in .gitignore!)
    API_KEY_Maps="YOUR_Maps_API_KEY"
    FIREBASE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="app/google-services.json"
    ```
    If your project requires files like `google-services.json`, download them from your Firebase console and add them to the `app/` directory.
5.  **Run the project:**
    Select an emulator or connect a physical Android device and click the "Run" button in Android Studio.
